This is our course assignment, which uses Docker images.
This project is divided into four parts: building the front-end, crawling, indexing, image recognition, corresponding to four folders.
I don't want to explain how to use these files, so please refer to the code instead of directly using them to create a webpage.
Thank you again for clicking into my repository.
